# Pile

Pile images into a single image via stitching, as simple as that is I found a way to make that more complex than it has to be.

**Disclaimer:** I was hopped up on coffee and little sleep when I put most of this together, please forgive some of the vomit.

### JAR

See [releases][rel] for JARs ready for importing.

### Documentation & Wiki

I've tried my best to fill out descriptive information for the Javadocs. Those by the way can be found [here][javadocs].

The wiki will have a few samples to look at. Hopefully they'll be good enough to demonstrate how to use Pile.
